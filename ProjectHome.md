The project will involve writing code allowing a Roomba vacuum cleaner to map a house, locate the robot’s position within the house, and determine the most efficient cleaning route dynamically. The algorithms involved are TBD but may include A**search, SLAM, or may be created to fit the needs of the project.**

The Roomba will begin at a set point each time (its home base). There are other home bases in the house with other robots attached, and the Roomba must not mistake another home base for its own.

The tools involved are a Roomba vacuum cleaner, a proprietary iRobot cable to connect a computer to the Roomba, and a laptop. The mapping will be created using the Roomba’s wall-following ability and bump sensors. The code base used to interact with the Roomba will be the PyRobot code.
